## Project description
Object-oriented Programming, or OOP for short, is a programming paradigm which provides a means of structuring programs so that properties and behaviours are bundled into individual objects.

This workshop is divided into two parts. 

In the first part, we’ll explore non-widely known Object-oriented Programming concepts in Python, such as:
- Inheritance and Multi-inheritance
- Composition

In the second part, we’ll round up the first part and explore more non-widely known Object-oriented Programming concepts in Python, such as:
- Dataclasses
